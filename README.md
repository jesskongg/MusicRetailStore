# Music_Retail_Store

# Project Description
Our group has chosen to develop a web-based information system for a retail music store. The web application will be used by store management and employees to handle daily business and management operations. Our system will provide the following functionality:

# Employee Management
* Insert, delete and update employee information
* Store and display employee information (i.e. ID, Name, Phone, Address, General Availabilities, Hourly Wage, Weekly Schedule) 
* Search function for employee availabilities
* Calculate total hours an employee has worked in a time frame and the amount of payment owed to employee

# Inventory Management
* Insert, delete, and update stock availability of music for staff (for merchandising)
* Store music stock information (i.e. ID, Title, Artist, Album Name, Genre, Supplier, Format)
* Search function for finding specific music product
* Sort and display music inventory by categories
* Display total sales over a timeframe, total sales of specific items, total sales per employee

# Customer Management
* Insert and update customers
* Customer information (i.e. ID, Name, Address, Email, Phone, Purchase History, Loyalty Membership)

# Point of Sale
* Enable staff to sell inventory, process returns - associated with employee ID
* Update inventory and maintain transaction records.

# Platform
The front-end user interface will be crafted with HTML and CSS, and will use JavaScript for UI enhancements as well as validating and submitting user input/queries. PHP and MySQL will be used for the back-end web server and database storage/management. These choices minimize framework dependencies and will allow a single server to provide both database and web server functionality, simplifying the development process.
