# Music Retail Store

## Project Description
Our group developed a web-based information system for a retail music store. The web application will be used by store management and employees to efficiently manage day-to-day business operations. Our system will provide the following functionality:

### Employee Management
* Insert, delete and update employee information
* Store and display employee information (i.e. ID, Name, Phone, Address, General Availabilities, Hourly Wage, Weekly Schedule) 
* Search for employees' availability
* Calculate the total hours a particular employee has worked and the remaining payment owed to employee

### Inventory Management
* Insert, delete, and update the stock availability of music for staff (for merchandising)
* Store music stock information (i.e. ID, Title, Artist, Album Name, Genre, Supplier, Format)
* Search for a specific music product
* Sort and display music inventory by categories
* Display total sales over a timeframe, total sales of specific items, total sales per employee

### Customer Management
* Insert and update customers
* Customer information (i.e. ID, Name, Address, Email, Phone, Purchase History, Loyalty Membership)

### Point of Sale
* Enable staff to sell inventory, process returns - associated with employee ID
* Update inventory and maintain transaction records.

# Platform
The front-end user interface was developed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These technologies provided UI enhancements, and input validation. PHP and MySQL were used for the back-end web server and database storage/management. These choices simplified the development process by minimizing framework dependencies and allowed a single server to provide both database and web server functionality.
